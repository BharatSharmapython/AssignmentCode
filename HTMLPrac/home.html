<p>Institutional Innovation Cell (IIC) has been established in the campus of Jagan Institute of Management Studies (JIMS), Rohini, to encourage, support and promote entrepreneurial abilities among the students across all programs. Nowadays there is an immense need to bring students into ‘start-up culture’ and provide a platform where they can convert their bright ideas into innovation. IIC ambitious plan is to give boost to ‘Make in India’ and ‘StartUp India’ initiatives of the Government of India and make the students ‘Employment Provider’ rather than the ‘Employment Seeker’.
